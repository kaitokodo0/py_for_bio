"""
The sequence contains a recognition site for the EcoRI restriction enzyme, which
cuts at the motif G*AATTC (the position of the cut is indicated by an asterisk).
Write a program which will calculate the size of the two fragments that will be
produced when the DNA sequence is digested with EcoRI.
