"""
The file genomic_dna.txt contains a section of genomic DNA, 
and the file exons.txt contains a list of start/stop positions 
of exons. Each exon is on a separate line and the start and stop 
positions are separated by a comma. Write a program that will
extract the exon segments, concatenate them, and write them 
to a new file.
